# Pong Clone
A clone of the classic pong game written in pygame. Run the pong.py file to start. 

NOTE: I use the Ditial-7 font from [here](https://www.1001fonts.com/digital-7-font.html) to display the scores. I'm uncertain about whether it's OK for me to commit this font file to the repo so I've not done so. It's free for personal use so you need to download this file and place it in the assets/fonts folder for it to work. If you leave the folder empty, then a default font is used.
